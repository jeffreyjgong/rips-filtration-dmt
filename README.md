# rips-filtration-dmt
An implementation of an algorithm for a filtration-induced discrete Morse function to compute the homotopy of the Vietoris-Rips Complex of evenly spaced points on the planar unit circle.

Not meant to be the most efficient thing ever - just does what I need it to do. Although there is some cool optimizations I made in here - notably regarding enumerating subsets and union find for checking fully connectedness.
